# Interactive Python Function
This is an example of a Python function I created that allows users to explore a dataset using an interactive menu. 

The function will help the user upload the dataset (CustomerCombinedFinal.csv) before prompting exploration. The user is able to add their own inputs in order to look the relationship between two variables of their choice or to see a bar graph of the categorical variable of their choice. It also allows users to see the answer to three previously completed analyses about the data set

# Files
The following files are available to download:
1. HTML: Final write up of project including all code, visuals and analysis. This is all you need to see the full project
2. Code: Python code file. This allows you to re-run the analysis on your own.
3. Data: The CSV file dataset. This allows you to re-run the analysis on your own.
